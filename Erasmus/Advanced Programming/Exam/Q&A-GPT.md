**What is a computational system?**: A computational system, within a specified domain, is a framework capable of reasoning and taking action. It is typically represented by internal structures and processes.

**Is a program considered a computational system?**: No, a program serves as a description of a system. However, when a program is executed, it becomes an instance of a computational system.

**What constitutes a computational meta-system?**: A computational meta-system possesses the ability to reason about other systems. Examples include debuggers and profilers, which can analyze and comprehend programs within their domain.

**Could you elaborate on the concept of reflection?**: Reflection refers to a system's capability to introspect and reason about itself.

**How would you define a reflective system?**: A reflective system is one that, given a system, has itself as an Object-system. It can manipulate its structure and behavior dynamically at runtime.

**What distinguishes introspection in computing?**: Introspection enables a program to analyze its own structure and behavior.

**And what about intercession?**: Intercession, within a program, allows for the modification of its structure and behavior dynamically.

**How would you define reification in the context of computing?**: Reification involves creating an entity within a meta-system to represent an entity within the object system. Essentially, it's about representing aspects of the object system within the meta-system.

**Could you provide an example of reification in code?**:

```java
class A {
    int x;
    void m() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

// Reification
Class c = A.class;
```

**Why is reification considered a precondition for reflection?**: Reification establishes the foundation for a meta-system to reason about objects within the system, laying the groundwork for reflective capabilities.

**What are the differences between structural and behavioral reification?**: Structural reification involves representing the structure of a program, while behavioral reification pertains to representing its execution.

**What challenges does reification pose?**: Reification can complicate compilation, slow down execution, and introduce hard-coded dependencies.

**What are reference types in Java programming?**: Reference types are those which hold references to objects rather than containing the actual data themselves. They contrast with primitive types, which directly store data.

**Can you explain the concept of reified types?**: Reified types in Java are those for which there exists a unique instance of the class `java.lang.Class` representing the type.

**What are some important methods available in the `Class` class in Java?**: Key methods include `getName()`, `getSuperclass()`, `isArray()`, `getMethods()`, and `getDeclaredMethods()`, among others.

**What is multiple dispatch, and does Java support it?**: Multiple dispatch involves selecting a method to call based on the types of multiple arguments. Java lacks native support for multiple dispatch.

**How does Java choose which method to call?**: Java employs dynamic dispatch, selecting the appropriate method based on the type of the object at runtime.

**What might be a solution for achieving multiple dispatch in Java?**: One approach could involve typecasting within the method to handle different argument types explicitly.

**Could you explain the concept of double dispatch in Java?**: Double dispatch is a pattern where the calling object modifies the called object and passes a reference to itself. The called object then implements a method for each class that can be passed as an argument.

**What is the defined method call mechanism in Java?**: It's a mechanism where the appropriate method to call is determined based on the type of the calling object. This dynamic dispatch is beneficial for polymorphism but insufficient for multiple dispatch.

**What issues arise with the boxing and unboxing of primitive types in Java?**: Boxing and unboxing can lead to performance overhead and introduce ambiguity regarding the behavior of methods that accept objects versus primitives.

**What is LISP, and what are some of its dialects?**: LISP is a programming language known for its features and functional programming paradigm. Some dialects include Scheme, Common LISP, and Clojure.

**How are functions defined in different LISP dialects?**: While the syntax may vary slightly, functions can be defined using constructs like `defun` in LISP, Common LISP, and Emacs LISP, and `defn` in Clojure.

**What is the purpose of CAR and CDR in LISP?**: These are primitive functions used to access the first element and the rest of a list, respectively.

**What is the distinction between CAR and FIRST in LISP?**: While they serve the same purpose, CAR is used in LISP, whereas FIRST is used in Scheme, both referring to the first element of a list.

**What is tracing in LISP, and how is it implemented?**: Tracing involves printing arguments and results at each call of a function. It's implemented using behavioral introspection.

**What is metaprogramming, and how does it relate to LISP?**: Metaprogramming involves programs treating other programs as data, enabling tasks like reading, generating, analyzing, or transforming code. LISP facilitates metaprogramming due to its flexible syntax and powerful evaluation model.

**What are macros in LISP, and why are they useful?**: Macros are like functions but operate on code rather than data, enabling code transformations and abstraction. They are invaluable for metaprogramming tasks.

**How does memoization work, and why is it beneficial?**: Memoization involves caching the results of function calls to improve performance by avoiding redundant computations, particularly useful for functions with repetitive or expensive calls.

**What is Javassist, and how does it enable metaprogramming in Java?**: Javassist is a library facilitating bytecode manipulation in Java, allowing developers to modify class definitions at runtime, opening doors to metaprogramming capabilities.

**Could you explain the concept of a metacircular evaluator?**: A metacircular evaluator is an interpreter for a language written in the same language. It's a form of self-interpreter, commonly employed in language implementation and modification.

**What role do REPLs play in programming environments?**: REPLs provide an interactive environment for programming, allowing users to enter commands, evaluate expressions, and receive immediate feedback.

**How does variable shadowing impact program execution?**: Variable shadowing occurs when an inner scope declares a variable with the same name as one in an outer scope, potentially leading to confusion or unintended behavior due to ambiguity in variable references.

**What challenges does evaluating definitions pose in our evaluator?**: Evaluating definitions can alter the environment and execution order, introducing complexity in managing variable bindings and scope.

**How does the use of the `global` keyword address issues with variable scope?**: By specifying `global`, the evaluator accesses variables from the outer scope, mitigating conflicts and ensuring consistent behavior across scopes.

**What is the purpose of the `set` keyword in our evaluator?** 

The `set` keyword is utilized to update the value of a variable in the environment. It enables modifying the value of a variable, even if it's outside the current scope.

**How does the ordering of evaluation impact our evaluator's functionality?**

In our evaluator, the ordering of evaluation dictates the sequence in which the arguments of a function are assessed. By evaluating arguments from left to right and employing `begin` and `end`, we establish a consistent behavior. The implementation involves identifying `begin`, evaluating its arguments, and returning the last one.

**Why is considering implicit `begin` important in our evaluator?**

Implicit `begin` ensures that function arguments are evaluated within a block, facilitating consistent left-to-right evaluation. This approach guarantees that the last argument's value is returned, aligning with the expected behavior within `let` and `flet` constructs.

**What challenges arise from using multiple namespaces in our Lisp evaluator?**

The primary challenge with multiple namespaces lies in distinguishing whether something passed as a function argument is a function or not. Attempts to address this led to complexities, as everything in function position was being evaluated as a function. The introduction of `funcall` complicated the code further.

**How do anonymous functions contribute to simplifying our evaluator?**

Anonymous functions, often created using the combination of `def` and `lambda`, streamline our evaluator by providing concise, inline function definitions without the need for explicit naming. This approach enhances code readability and reduces clutter.

**What led to the decision of removing the macro `eval` from our evaluator?**

The decision to remove the macro `eval` stemmed from the perspective of macros as tagged functions, with checks conducted during function evaluation. This paradigm shift eliminated the need for a separate macro `eval`, streamlining the evaluator's architecture.

**Why is hygiene crucial in macro programming, and how do we ensure it in our evaluator?**

Hygiene in macro programming prevents unintended interference with variables in the code, averting unexpected behavior. In our evaluator, hygiene is maintained by leveraging techniques like `gensym` to generate unique symbols, thus avoiding name collisions.

**What is the significance of reifying the environment in our evaluator?**

Reifying the environment involves creating an entity representing the object system within the meta-system. This process allows us to effectively represent the environment in which functions are evaluated, facilitating better control and manipulation within our evaluator.

**How do continuations enhance the capabilities of our evaluator?**

Continuations capture the future state of computation, enabling us to save and resume computations from specific points. This feature enhances flexibility and control within our evaluator, supporting advanced programming constructs and execution flow management.

**What role does nondeterminism play in our evaluator, and how is it implemented?**

Nondeterminism allows our evaluator to explore multiple potential outcomes of a computation. Implemented through functions like `amb` and `fails`, nondeterminism enables the generation and exploration of various computation paths, supporting a broader range of problem-solving strategies.

**How does CLOS support multiple dispatch, and what advantages does it offer?**

CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) facilitates multiple dispatch, allowing the selection of the method to call based on the runtime types of multiple arguments. This feature enhances flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented programming, enabling more expressive and adaptable code structures.

**What is the purpose of method combination in CLOS?**

Method combination in CLOS provides a mechanism to combine the results of multiple methods, offering flexibility in method invocation and result aggregation. It allows developers to customize method invocation behavior, tailoring it to specific requirements or preferences.

**How does the generic function correct method finding process work in CLOS?**

The process of correct method finding involves several steps:
1. **Select Applicable Methods:** Determine all methods applicable to the given arguments based on their parameter specializers.
2. **Order Methods:** Arrange the applicable methods according to their precedence order.
3. **Combine Methods:** Combine the ordered methods using the method combination specified for the generic function.
4. **Produce Effective Method:** Generate an effective method, which represents the combined behavior of the selected methods, ready for execution.

This systematic approach ensures that the most appropriate method is invoked based on the runtime types of the arguments, adhering to the principles of polymorphism and dynamic dispatch in CLOS.

**What is the role of the class precedence list in CLOS, and where is it utilized?**

The class precedence list (CPL) dictates the order in which classes are searched for method implementations during method resolution and inheritance. It represents the linearized hierarchy of classes, ensuring a consistent and predictable method lookup mechanism.

The CPL is utilized primarily in class inheritance scenarios, where it determines the order in which methods are inherited and overridden. By defining a strict order for class traversal, the CPL facilitates method resolution, resolving ambiguities, and ensuring coherent method invocation behavior across the inheritance hierarchy.
