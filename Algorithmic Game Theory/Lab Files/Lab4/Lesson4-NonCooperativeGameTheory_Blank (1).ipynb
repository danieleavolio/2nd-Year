    "# Non-cooperative Game Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In non-cooperative game theory, we study games in which players cannot make binding agreements and so they cannot form coalitions. Non-cooperative games are also called *strategic games*.\n",
    "Strategic games tipically describe situations of conflict between self-interested players, who, as a result of their actions (choices) want to maximise their own uitility.\n",
    "In strategic games, players typically have different utilities and different incentives to choose their actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider strategic games, we are typically interested in answering the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the optimal outcome?\n",
    "- What is the a player's best response another player's action?\n",
    "- Which course of action represents an equilibrium in a given game? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Normal Form games\n",
    "Let's begin by formalizing games and defining what a normal form game is.\n",
    "An $N$ player normal form game consists of\n",
    "- A finite set of $N$ players\n",
    "- Action set for the players $\\{ A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N \\}$ \n",
    "- A payoff (utility) function for each player $i \\in N$: $u_i: A_1 \\times A_2 \\times \\dots \\times A_N \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will limit our treatment to 2 player games. The concepts we are going to see can be extended to games of arbitrary number of players. However, going beyond two player games is hard and the best known algorithms to solve games have exponential complexity.\n",

    "### Nash equilibrium in games of pure coordination\n",
    "A game of pure coordination is a game with the following structure:\n",

    "| **right** | 0, 0 | $a$, $a$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of such a game as follows: the two players are walking towards each other in a road. If they both walk on their right or on their left, they avoid a collition and get a positive payoff. If they do not coordinate and walk one on their right and the other on their left, they will have a collision. This game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (**left**, **left**) and (**right**, **right**).\n",

    "| **A** | 2, 1 | 0, 0 | \n",
    "| **C** | 0, 0 | 1, 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This game describes the situation of a couple who wants to go to the cinema to watch a movie. The couple is considering two movies: the husband is heavily leaning towards an action movie (denoted with **A**); the wife is heavily leaning towards a comedy (denoted with **C**). More importantly, they want to go together. So, if they go to watch the movie **A** the husband gets a payoff of 2 and the wife gets a payoff of 1; conversely, if they go to watch the movie **C** the husband gets a payoff of 1 and the wife gets a payoff of 2. In case they decide to watch two different movies (i.e. the husband goes for the action movie and the wife goes for the comedy), they do not get any payoff. So, this game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria, where the best pure response is to match what the other player chooses. In this regards, the game is similar to a pure coordination game. However, there is an important difference between the battle of the sexes and a pure coordination game: the payoff is asymmetrical. If one of the players always gets it their way, the other player will loose quite a lot. In order to maximise both players' payoffs, **ideally**, the couple should organise in such a way to go to watch action movies 50% of the times and comedy the other 50% of the times. However, they have no way to do this if they do not know in advance what the other player will play.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a zero-sum game. In fact, the sum of the payoffs in each cell of the matrix is 0.\n",
    "In this game, the two players have to choose between head and tail. The row player wins if the the colulmn player chooses the same option chosen by the row player. Conversely, the column player wins if the players' choices are different.\n",
    "This game does not have any *pure strategy* Nash equilibrium. This happens because there is no action profile such that both players would not change their action after knowing what the opponent has played. If the row player plays Head (respective Tail) the column player wants to play Tail (respective Head). But if the column player plays Head (respective Tail) then the row player wants to play Head (respective Tail). So, there is no *pure* choice here that would be stable for both players, no matter what the other player does.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we ponder the \"Matching Pennies\" game we easily come up with the fact that since one player does not know what the other player plays, the best thing a player can do is to chose completely at random (in this case with probability 0.5) between Head and Tail. Such a strategy, which involves a probability distribution over the alternatives, is known as *mixed strategy*. We will see mixed strategies later on in this notebook."

    "If we are dealing with non zero-sum games, things becomea bit more complicated and the minimax principle we have seen before does no longer apply. For $2 \\times 2$ matrices, there still exist a simple algorithm we can use to compute a mixed Nash equilibrium. we are going to see and implement this aglorithm here. The idea we are going to see is called *indifference condition*. This idea can be generalised to implement algorithm to compute equilibra in generic games, although those algorithms are not efficient. \n",

    "Let's recall that a *support* is the set of pure strategies that receive positive probability under the mixed strategy of the players. In a $2 \\times 2$ game, a support for a mixed strategy always involves all the 2 actions. As such, a strategy for the row player is a probability distribution $\\sigma_r = (p, 1-p)$ over the two possible actions and, similarly, a strategy for the column player is a probability distribution $\\sigma_c = (q, 1-q)$. Recalling the general condition for best response discussed previously, if $\\sigma_r$ is a best response to $\\sigma_c$, then $(A\\sigma_c^T)_i = \\text{max}_{k\\in\\{1, 2\\}} (A\\sigma_c^T)_k \\text{ for all }i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. In other words, let $A$ be the payoff matrix of the row player, if $\\sigma_r$ is a best response to $\\sigma_c$, the following *indifference condition* must hold: $qA_{11} + (1-q)A_{12} = qA_{21} + (1-q)A_{22}$.
