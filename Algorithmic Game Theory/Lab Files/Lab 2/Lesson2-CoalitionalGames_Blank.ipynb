    "# Coalitional Games: Representation, Solution concepts, and Issues\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use computation to explore and solve coalitional games.\n",
    "Coalitional games, also known as Transferable Utility (TU) games, are a particular class of games where the payoff is not given to a single player but to a group (coalition) of players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utility is *transferable* if one player can transfer part of their utility to another player, without loss. Such transfers are possible if the players have a common currency that is valued equally by all the players. It's important to note that we are still talking about utility. So, for instance, being able to transfer cash payoffs does not imply that *utility* is transferable: wealthy and poor players may derive a different utility from the same amount of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a group of players joins forces to reach a common goal, for example by pooling their money to buy a common good, the players need to decide how to divide the payoff. We will see how to answer this question! </br>\n",
    "We might also want to know what coalitions are likely to emerge. This might be a tough question, since if we have n players, then we have $2^n$ possible coalitions."

    "1. The naive representation of the characteristic function is exponential in the number of players n: We need to list all the $2^n$ coalitions;\n",
    "2. Computationally expensive algorithms: Checking the stability of an outcome or computing the Shapley value require to go over $2^n$ coalitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we have the following strategies to tackle these two problems:\n",
    "1. Focusing on *restricted classes* of games; for instance, games on combinatorial structures such as routing games. The problem here is that we give up on representing other interesting games.\n",
    "2. Developing approximated algorithms to solve games; for instance, we can approximate the computation of the Shapley value. We give up on the exact solution but we reduce the computational time.\n",
    "3. Using compact representations for games; instead of representing the characteristic function in a naive way, we can use networked structures to obtain compact but expressive representations.\n",
